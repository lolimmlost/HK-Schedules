# Privacy Policy and Disclaimer

**Effective Date:** September 17, 2025  
**Last Updated:** September 17, 2025  

Welcome to HK-Schedules (the "Service"), provided by ["Appahouse", "HK-Schedules"] (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), the ePrivacy Directive (as implemented in national laws), and other relevant regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where applicable.

This Privacy Policy and Disclaimer explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website [Appahouse.com], use our web application, or interact with our services. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide, improve, and secure our Service. We minimize data collection to what is necessary and only process personal data with a valid legal basis under GDPR (e.g., consent, legitimate interest, or contract performance).

### 1.1 Personal Information
- **User-Provided Data:** When you create an account, import schedules, or interact with features, we may collect:
  - Name, email address, or other identifiers (if account registration is enabled).
  - Schedule data (e.g., events, dates, descriptions) uploaded via CSV or manual entry. This may include personal details if you input them (e.g., names in housekeeping schedules).
- **Legal Basis:** Consent (for optional features) or performance of a contract (for core functionality).

### 1.2 Non-Personal Information
- **Usage Data:** Automatically collected via browser logs, including IP address (anonymized where possible), browser type, device information, pages visited, time and date of access, and interaction patterns (e.g., button clicks).
- **Schedule Analytics:** Aggregated, anonymized insights from your schedules (e.g., average number of tasks) to improve the Service, without identifying individuals.
- **Legal Basis:** Legitimate interest (e.g., service improvement, security).

### 1.3 Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., localStorage, sessionStorage) to enhance functionality, analyze usage, and remember preferences. Our use is GDPR- and ePrivacy-compliant, with clear consent mechanisms.

- **Essential Cookies:** Required for core functionality (e.g., maintaining login sessions, schedule state). These are not used for tracking and do not require consent.
  - Examples: `session_id` (expires on browser close), `theme_preference` (persistent for user experience).
- **Analytics Cookies:** Used for aggregated usage insights (e.g., via Google Analytics or similar, if integrated). These track anonymized behavior across sessions.
  - Examples: `_ga` (persistent, 2 years).
  - Consent Required: Yes, via cookie banner. Users can opt-out at any time.
- **Third-Party Cookies:** If we embed third-party services (e.g., export tools), their cookies apply. We only use trusted partners compliant with GDPR (e.g., no unnecessary trackers).
- **Cookie Management:** On first visit, a consent banner appears. You can manage preferences via [insert link to settings, e.g., /settings/privacy]. We respect Do Not Track (DNT) signals and global privacy controls (GPC). No cookies are set without consent except essentials.

For EU/EEA users: Under the ePrivacy Directive, we obtain explicit consent for non-essential cookies before placement. Consent is granular (e.g., accept analytics separately from marketing, if any).

**Note:** This Service does not use advertising cookies or sell data to third parties. All cookies are first-party unless explicitly noted.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data solely for legitimate purposes:
- To provide and maintain the Service (e.g., storing and displaying your schedules).
- To improve functionality (e.g., bug fixes, feature development based on anonymized analytics).
- To communicate with you (e.g., service updates, if subscribed).
- For security and fraud prevention (e.g., detecting unusual activity).
- To comply with legal obligations (e.g., responding to lawful requests).

We do not use data for automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significant impacts without human oversight.

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or share personal data for marketing. Disclosure is limited:
- **Service Providers:** With trusted third parties (e.g., cloud hosting like Vercel/AWS, analytics tools) under strict data processing agreements (DPAs) ensuring GDPR compliance (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers outside EEA).
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, court order, or to protect rights/safety (e.g., abuse reports).
- **Business Transfers:** In case of merger/acquisition, data may transfer with notice.
- **With Consent:** Only if you explicitly agree (e.g., sharing schedules via export).

No data is transferred to countries without adequate protection (e.g., non-EEA without safeguards).

## 4. Data Retention and Security

- **Retention:** Personal data is kept only as long as necessary:
  - Schedule data: Until account deletion or 30 days after last activity (configurable).
  - Usage logs: Anonymized after 12 months.
  - Under GDPR, we honor data erasure requests unless legally required to retain.
- **Security:** We implement reasonable safeguards (e.g., encryption in transit/rest, access controls, regular audits). However, no system is impenetrable; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
- **Children's Privacy:** The Service is not directed at children under 16 (or higher age per local laws). We do not knowingly collect their data.

## 5. Your Rights (GDPR and Global)

Depending on your location, you have rights regarding your data:
- **Access:** Request a copy of your personal data.
- **Rectification:** Correct inaccurate data.
- **Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):** Delete your data (subject to legal exceptions).
- **Restriction:** Limit processing in certain cases.
- **Portability:** Receive data in a structured format.
- **Objection:** Object to processing based on legitimate interests.
- **Withdraw Consent:** At any time, without affecting prior processing.

To exercise rights, contact us at [Juan@Appahouse.com]. We respond within 30 days (or 1 month under GDPR). For EU users, you may lodge complaints with your supervisory authority (e.g., via [edpb.europa.eu]).

CCPA/CPRA: California residents have rights to know, delete, and opt-out of "sales" (we do not sell data). Opt-out via GPC or our settings.

## 6. International Data Transfers

If you access the Service from outside the US/EEA, your data may transfer to the US (where servers are hosted). We use GDPR-approved mechanisms (e.g., SCCs) for adequacy.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

**No Warranty:** The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.

**Limitation of Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (e.g., loss of data, profits), even if advised of the possibility. Total liability shall not exceed $100 or the amount paid in the past 12 months.

**User Responsibility:** You are responsible for the accuracy of uploaded data and compliance with laws (e.g., not inputting sensitive personal data without consent). We are not liable for user-generated content.

**Third-Party Links/Services:** We are not responsible for external sites or services.
