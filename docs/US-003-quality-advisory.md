# US-003 Quality Advisory: Accessibility, Validation, and Best Practices

## Executive Summary
As Test Architect & Quality Advisor, this advisory provides recommendations for ensuring high quality in the housekeeping schedule management feature (US-003). Focus areas include accessibility for low-tech users, validation strategies for data integrity, performance optimization for large datasets (130+ units), and usability guidelines. These recommendations align with WCAG 2.1 AA, PRD v2 requirements, and the test plan in [US-003-test-plan.md](US-003-test-plan.md).

**Key Principles**: Simplicity drives quality—prioritize intuitive interfaces over complex features; validate early and often; test with real user personas; monitor performance proactively.

## 1. Accessibility Recommendations
Given Rick's low tech-savvy profile, accessibility is critical for adoption. Target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with emphasis on low-vision, motor-impaired, and screen reader users.

### 1.1 Core Guidelines
- **Perceivable**: Ensure all content is accessible via multiple senses.
  - Use semantic HTML: `<select>` for dropdowns with `<option>` labels; `<table>` with `<th scope="col">` for schedules.
  - ARIA attributes: `aria-label="Housekeeper selection"` on dropdowns; `aria-live="polite"` for auto-save announcements ("Entry updated for Unit 101").
  - High-contrast mode: Implement CSS media query `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` with 4.5:1 text ratio; test with Windows High Contrast theme.
- **Operable**: Make interactions keyboard and touch friendly.
  - Keyboard navigation: Ensure tab order follows logical flow (housekeeper list → form → save); focus styles visible (e.g., `outline: 2px solid blue`).
  - Touch targets: Minimum 48x48px for buttons/dropdowns; spacing ≥8px between elements to prevent mis-taps.
  - Time limits: No auto-timeouts on edits; allow pausing for slow users.
- **Understandable**: Clear language and predictable behavior.
  - Simple text: Avoid jargon (e.g., "Add Team Member" instead of "Create Assignee"); reading level ≤8th grade.
  - Consistent navigation: Print button always top-right; error messages actionable ("Unit 101 is already scheduled. Change it?").
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies.
  - Screen readers: Test with NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), TalkBack (Android); announce dynamic changes (e.g., filter applied).
  - Tools: Run axe-core or WAVE audits; fix all critical/serious issues before release.

### 1.2 Implementation Checklist
- Add `role="region"` to main sections (e.g., housekeeper list).
- Use `aria-describedby` for form fields linking to help text.
- Enable reduced motion: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable animations on edits.
- Print accessibility: Ensure PDF exports have tagged structure for screen readers; alt text for any icons.

### 1.3 Testing Approach
- Reference TC-023 to TC-025 in [test plan](US-003-test-plan.md); aim for 100% Lighthouse accessibility score.
- Recruit diverse testers: Include users with disabilities (e.g., via UserTesting.com panels).
- Metrics: Zero WCAG failures; 95% successful navigation via keyboard/screen reader.

## 2. Validation Strategies
Since auto-assignment is out of scope, focus on manual entry validation to prevent errors in predetermined schedules. Emphasize data integrity for even distribution through optional reporting rather than enforcement.

### 2.1 Input Validation
- **Form-Level**: Real-time validation on keyup/blur events using Zod or native HTML5.
  - Unit ID: Required, numeric (1-999), unique within schedule (`new Set(units).size === units.length`).
  - Housekeeper: Required, must exist in housekeeper list (dropdown prevents invalid selections).
  - Time Slot: Required, one of ["Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"].
  - Status: Default "Pending", optional dropdown.
- **Save Validation**: Before persisting to localStorage, run comprehensive checks.
  - No duplicate units: Alert "Unit [ID] appears twice—remove one?" with list of conflicts.
  - Required fields: Block save if any entry missing unit/housekeeper/time; highlight invalid rows.
  - Date consistency: Week selection valid (no future dates beyond 1 year); prevent cross-week assignments.

### 2.2 Even Distribution Validation (Advisory, Non-Blocking)
- **Optional Reporting**: After save, calculate distribution: `housekeepers.map(h => countAssignments(h))`.
  - Generate summary: "John: 28 units, Jane: 25 units (3 unit difference)".
  - Threshold alert: If max-min >10% of total units, show warning "Distribution uneven—review assignments?" with option to regenerate view or proceed.
  - Visual Aid: Progress bars or badges in housekeeper list showing unit counts (e.g., "John (28/130)").
- **No Enforcement**: Allow uneven distributions for predetermined schedules; log imbalance for analytics (console.warn).
- **Edge Cases**: Handle 1 housekeeper (all units OK); odd totals (131 units → some get +1); zero units (empty schedule warning).

### 2.3 Error Handling & Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: If localStorage quota exceeded (rare for 130 entries), prompt "Storage full—export and clear?" with auto-export to JSON.
- **Offline Support**: All operations work offline; sync on reconnect (use `window.addEventListener('online')`).
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for all actions (success: green, warning: yellow, error: red); include undo where possible (e.g., 5s revert timer for deletes).
- **Logging**: Console errors with context (e.g., `console.error('Validation failed:', { unit: 101, error: 'duplicate' })`); no PII.

### 2.4 Testing Approach
- Reference TC-007, TC-019, TC-022 in [test plan](US-003-test-plan.md); add unit tests for validation utils in `src/lib/validation.ts`.
- Fuzz testing: Generate random invalid inputs (letters in unit ID, empty selections).
- Metrics: 100% validation coverage; false positives <1%; user recovery time <10s per error.

## 3. Performance Optimization Recommendations
For 130+ units on low-end devices, optimize rendering and storage.

### 3.1 Rendering Optimizations
- **Virtualization**: Use `react-window` or `react-virtualized` for tables with >50 rows; render only visible entries.
- **Memoization**: Wrap components with `React.memo` (e.g., entry rows); use `useMemo` for filtered lists (`const filteredEntries = useMemo(() => entries.filter(...), [entries, filter])`).
- **Debounced Inputs**: For search/filter, debounce 300ms to prevent re-renders on every keystroke.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load housekeeper list on demand; defer non-critical components (e.g., onboarding tour).

### 3.2 Storage & Persistence
- **Efficient localStorage**: Serialize schedules as JSON; compress large arrays (e.g., unit IDs as Uint8Array if needed); limit to 5MB quota check.
- **Batch Saves**: Group multiple edits into single localStorage write; use `localStorage.setItem` with transaction-like atomicity.
- **Background Sync**: For auto-saves, use `requestIdleCallback` to avoid blocking UI during high-load periods.

### 3.3 Print Performance
- **Client-Side PDF**: Use `react-to-print` or jsPDF for generation; pre-render table to canvas for large datasets to avoid DOM bloat.
- **Metrics**: Target <3s generation for 130 units; test on Chrome mobile (slower than desktop).
- **Fallback**: If PDF fails, offer browser print with custom `@media print` CSS.

### 3.4 Testing Approach
- Reference TC-016 to TC-018 in [test plan](US-003-test-plan.md); use Lighthouse Performance score >90.
- Load testing: Simulate 200 concurrent edits (if multi-tab); monitor memory (<200MB).
- Metrics: Core Web Vitals (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1); 60fps scrolling.

## 4. Usability & Low-Tech User Guidelines
Quality extends to user satisfaction—measure and iterate based on real feedback.

### 4.1 Metrics & KPIs
- **SUS Score**: Target >75 for low-tech users; benchmark against general population (68 average).
- **Task Completion**: 90% success rate for core workflows (setup → enter → print) in <5 minutes.
- **Error Rate**: <5% invalid inputs; <2 errors per session.
- **NPS**: Post-session survey: "How likely to recommend?" (target >7/10).

### 4.2 Best Practices
- **Onboarding**: Mandatory first-use tour (3 steps max); persistent skip; video demo option for complex actions.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic form; unlock advanced features (e.g., bulk edit) after successful first use.
- **Feedback Loops**: Inline help icons with tooltips; contextual help ("Need help? Click here for example"); in-app survey after print.
- **Persona-Based Design**: Model Rick as 55+, limited typing, prefers visual over text; test with similar demographics.

### 4.3 Continuous Improvement
- **A/B Testing**: Compare simple vs. advanced modes for task time; iterate on low performers.
- **Analytics**: Track usage (e.g., `localStorage` events for saves/prints); anonymized metrics only.
- **User Feedback**: Embed "Was this helpful?" buttons; collect qualitative data for v2.1 enhancements.

## 5. Risk Mitigation & Quality Gates
- **High-Risk Areas**: Large dataset performance (mitigate with virtualization); low-tech adoption (mitigate with usability testing); validation gaps (mitigate with comprehensive unit tests).
- **Quality Gates**:
  - **Alpha**: All unit tests pass; Lighthouse >85; no P0 bugs.
  - **Beta**: Usability sessions complete; SUS >70; performance benchmarks met.
  - **Release**: Full WCAG audit passed; 95% test coverage; user acceptance sign-off.
- **Rollback Plan**: If critical issues found post-release, provide data export/import to migrate back to basic scheduling.
