# US-002 Review: Enhanced Schedule Viewing and Filtering (FR-2)

## Executive Summary
US-002 extends the schedule viewing capabilities with assignee filtering, bulk actions, and persistent sort/filter preferences. It builds directly on US-001's dashboard and dynamic entries, enabling team leads to review workloads efficiently. Key enhancements include assignee dropdowns, checkbox-based bulk operations, and visual feedback for filtered results.

**Current Status (from US-002 Backlog)**: Core assignee filtering complete (~60% done). Assignee dropdown, unique extraction, filtering logic, "All Assignees" option, filter chips, and entry-level display (with assignee badges and highlighting) are implemented. Gaps remain in bulk actions (checkboxes, status changes, delete, undo), persistence (localStorage for preferences), loading states, toasts, and edge cases. App remains stable with no regressions to v1 viewing.

**Quality Assessment**: Good progress on core functionality; high testability for filtering logic. Risks center on bulk operation reliability and performance during large updates. Recommendations emphasize integration testing with US-001 migration and usability validation for bulk workflows.

**Overall Rating**: **Yellow (Proceed with Caution)** - Core filtering solid, but incomplete bulk features risk UX friction; complete pending tasks before US-003 integration.

## 1. Requirements Analysis
### 1.1 User Story & Acceptance Criteria
- **Story**: As a Team Lead, I want to filter by assignee so I can review workloads.
- **Key Requirements** (from PRD v2 3.1.2):
  - Extend `src/components/schedule-table.tsx` with assignee filter dropdown (dynamic from entries/config).
  - Bulk Actions: Checkbox row selection; status changes (Pending/Completed), delete; "Apply to Selected" button.
  - Persistence: Save preferences in localStorage per schedule.
  - Visuals: Assignee badges in rows; filter chip with count (e.g., "John (3/10 tasks)"); highlight filtered rows.
  - Edge Cases: No assignees shows all; bulk max 50 rows; undo via toast.
- **AC Validation**:
  - Filter re-renders <100ms: Performance testable.
  - Bulk updates auto-save: Integration with store.
  - No overlaps post-filter: Validation on apply.
  - Mobile responsive: Stacks appropriately.
- **Testability Score**: 8/10 - Observable UI changes; supports unit tests for logic, E2E for flows. Gaps: Bulk undo requires custom timing tests.

### 1.2 Dependencies & Scope
- **In Scope**: Filtering UI/logic, bulk operations, persistence.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced analytics (e.g., workload reports); cross-schedule bulk (per schedule only).
- **Dependencies**: Requires US-001 dynamic entries and dashboard for full context; extends v1 table unchanged.
- **Assumptions**: Assignees are strings/arrays in entries; <200 entries per schedule typical.

## 2. Current Implementation Assessment
Based on US-002-backlog.md (2025-09-16 status):
- **Completed**:
  - Assignee filter dropdown above table.
  - Unique assignees extraction from all entries/schedules.
  - Filtering logic to match selected assignee.
  - "All Assignees" option.
  - Filter chip with counts.
  - Refactored table for individual entries (expandable or separate).
  - Legacy single-entry display via migration.
  - Assignee badges and filtered row highlighting.
- **Partial/Gaps**:
  - Bulk Actions: No checkboxes, status changes, delete, or "Apply to Selected".
  - Persistence: No localStorage save/restore for filters/sorts.
  - UX: Missing loading states for filters, toast notifications.
  - Edge Cases: Untested for no assignees, empty schedules, overlaps validation, bulk limits, undo.
  - Performance: Filter <100ms unverified for large sets.
- **Code Quality Indicators**:
  - Stable: Existing schedules filter correctly; 3 sample schedules display with 2 filtered out (empty tasks).
  - Print view unaffected (no filtering applied).
  - Migration supports entry creation for valid v1 data.
  - Dependencies: @radix-ui/react-select installed; native select fallback ready.

**Recommendation**: Implement bulk actions and persistence next (3-4 days); add unit tests for filtering utils immediately.

## 3. Quality Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Test Coverage |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Bulk Action Failures (Race Conditions on Auto-Save) | High | High | Use Zustand transactions for atomic updates; debounce bulk applies. Test multi-tab scenarios. | Integration: 8 TC for bulk flows (select/apply/undo/conflict). |
| Filter Persistence Loss (localStorage Sync Issues) | Medium | Medium | On-load restore with fallback to defaults; validate stored data on read. | Unit: 5 TC for persistence utils; E2E: Preference retention across sessions. |
| Performance on Large Tables (200+ Entries) | Medium | High | Memoize filtered lists; virtualize table rows. Benchmark re-renders. | Load: Simulate 200 entries; target <100ms filter. |
| UX Inconsistencies (Mobile Bulk Selection) | Low | Medium | Touch-friendly checkboxes (44px min); test gestures. | Manual: 4 TC for mobile (iOS/Android emulators); Lighthouse Best Practices >90. |
| Migration Conflicts with Filtering (Legacy Data) | Low | Low | Ensure migrated entries have assignee fields; skip filter if missing. | Regression: 6 TC for v1 data post-migration filtering. |

- **Non-Functional Risks**: Accessibility (ARIA for dynamic filters); Security (sanitize assignee names to prevent injection).
- **Overall Risk Level**: Medium - Bulk incompleteness is primary concern; mitigate with phased testing.

## 4. Testing Recommendations
### 4.1 Test Strategy
- **Levels**:
  - **Unit**: Filter logic, assignee extraction, chip counts (Vitest; 80% coverage).
  - **Integration**: Table + store interactions (bulk updates, persistence).
  - **E2E**: Journeys like filter → select → bulk apply → verify toast/undo (Playwright).
  - **Performance**: Measure re-render times; load tests for 50-200 entries.
  - **Usability**: Team lead persona tests for workload review; error rate <3%.
  - **Compatibility**: v1 tables unchanged; cross-browser filtering.
- **Test Cases Overview** (High-Level; Full Plan in docs/US-002-test-plan.md):
  - TC-001-010: Filter application (assignee/all/no results/highlight).
  - TC-011-020: Bulk selection/actions (status change/delete/limit/undo).
  - TC-021-030: Persistence (save/restore per schedule).
  - TC-031-040: Edge cases (empty/migration/large data).
  - TC-041-050: Performance/UX (mobile, loading, toasts).
- **Automation Priority**: 80% automated (focus on core logic); manual for bulk UX.
- **Defect Prediction**: Selection state bugs during rapid filters; undo timing issues.

### 4.2 Quality Gates
- **Alpha**: Core filtering + basic bulk pass; unit tests 100%.
- **Beta**: Full bulk/ persistence; usability sign-off; integration with US-001.
- **Release**: Regression suite clean; performance verified; no data inconsistencies.
- **Metrics**: Test coverage >85%; bug density <2 per feature; load time variance <50ms.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Add checkboxes and bulk logic (2 days).
  2. Implement persistence and toasts (1 day).
  3. Test edge cases and performance.
- **Quality Enhancements**:
  - Add loading spinners for bulk operations.
  - Validate overlaps on bulk status changes.
  - Exploratory testing for filter + print interactions.
- **Long-Term**: Integrate with US-003 housekeeper filters; analytics for filter usage.
- **Dependencies**: Await US-001 dashboard for full flows; coordinate with Dev for bulk implementation.
