# 2. Problem Statement

Users currently rely on spreadsheets (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel) or disparate tools (e.g., Trello for tasks, Google Calendar for events) for scheduling, leading to:

- **Errors and Inconsistencies**: Manual data entry causes duplicates or missed updates.
- **Version Conflicts**: Shared files result in overwrite issues and confusion over "latest" version.
- **Poor Printability and Sharing**: Formatting breaks on print; no native mobile optimization.
- **Lack of Integration**: No seamless workflow between creation, viewing, and export.

HK-Schedules addresses this by offering a dedicated, user-friendly platform with built-in validation, visualization, search/filtering, and multi-format export capabilities, reducing setup time from hours to minutes.

## 2.1 Competitive Analysis

- **Google Calendar**: Strong for events but weak on tabular schedules and team assignments; no offline editing.
- **Microsoft Outlook/Teams**: Enterprise-focused, overkill for small teams; high cost.
- **Asana/Trello**: Task management with calendars, but not specialized for printable schedules.
- **Doodle/SkedPal**: Meeting scheduling, lacks custom entry fields.
- **Differentiation**: HK-Schedules focuses on simple, printable tabular schedules with local-first persistence, ideal for non-tech users.
