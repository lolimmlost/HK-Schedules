# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Product Overview

HK-Schedules is a web-based application designed to streamline schedule management for users such as event organizers, teams, or individuals. It allows users to create, edit, view, and print schedules in a tabular format. Built with modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui), the app provides an intuitive interface for handling recurring or one-time events, assignments, and timelines.

The core value proposition is simplicity and efficiency: users can quickly input schedule details via forms, visualize them in interactive tables, and generate printable outputs without needing complex software.
