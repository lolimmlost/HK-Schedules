# US-001 Review: Multi-Schedule Dashboard (FR-1)

## Executive Summary
US-001 introduces the core multi-schedule dashboard, replacing the single-view entry point with a responsive list of schedules (cards/grid) supporting search, filters, pagination, and CRUD integration. This foundational feature enables team-based workflows in HK-Schedules v2, maintaining 100% backward compatibility with v1. 

**Current Status (from US-002 Backlog)**: Partial implementation (~20% complete). Basic single-entry form with localStorage CRUD exists, but critical gaps include dynamic entries array, full field support, advanced validation (Zod), multi-schedule dashboard component, and v1-to-v2 data migration. No major blockers identified, but performance risks for >50 schedules and migration compatibility require attention.

**Quality Assessment**: High testability potential with clear acceptance criteria, but current partial state exposes risks in data integrity and UX consistency. Recommendations focus on comprehensive testing strategy, risk mitigations, and quality gates to ensure reliability before integrating with US-002/US-003.

**Overall Rating**: **Green (Proceed with Mitigations)** - Strong foundation in PRD; address gaps early to avoid downstream defects.

## 1. Requirements Analysis
### 1.1 User Story & Acceptance Criteria
- **Story**: As an Admin, I want a dashboard to list and manage multiple schedules so I can organize by client or shift.
- **Key Requirements** (from PRD v2 3.1.1):
  - Dashboard component (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx`) replacing single-view.
  - Responsive list: Cards/grid showing title, category badge, entry count, last updated, quick actions (view/edit/delete).
  - Search: Global input for title/description (case-insensitive, 300ms debounce).
  - Filters: Dropdowns for category/date range; pagination for >20 schedules.
  - CRUD: "Create New" pre-fills category in `schedule-form.tsx`; edit pre-loads data.
  - Empty State: Illustrated CTA for first schedule.
  - Data: Extend localStorage to array of Schedules; load 50 schedules <1s.
- **AC Validation**:
  - Loads 50 schedules <1s: Measurable via performance tools.
  - Search updates live: Functional/UX testable.
  - Delete confirms with toast: Edge case coverage needed.
  - Mobile stacks as list: Responsive testing essential.
- **Testability Score**: 9/10 - Discrete, observable behaviors; supports unit/integration/E2E tests. Gaps: Vague "quick actions" needs UI spec clarification.

### 1.2 Dependencies & Scope
- **In Scope**: UI components (shadcn/ui Card/Table), localStorage extension, basic persistence.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced analytics, cloud sync (future epics).
- **Dependencies**: US-001 enables US-002 (filtering on dashboard), US-003 (housekeeping mode toggle). Relies on v1 components unchanged.
- **Assumptions**: localStorage quota sufficient for 50+ schedules (~5MB); no auth (local-first app).

## 2. Current Implementation Assessment
Based on US-002-backlog.md (2025-09-15 review):
- **Completed**: Basic form with title/description; localStorage save/load for single schedules; TypeScript compliance.
- **Partial/Gaps**:
  - No dynamic entries (single vs. array): Blocks multi-entry schedules.
  - Missing fields: Category, recurrence, duration, status, notes.
  - No dashboard: App loads single-view; multi-schedules not listed.
  - Validation: Basic only; lacks Zod schemas, overlap checks.
  - Migration: Display-only logic exists but non-destructive; full v1→v2 array conversion pending.
- **Code Quality Indicators**:
  - Stable: No crashes; existing schedules display/add/edit work.
  - Risks: Potential data loss on migration; performance untested for scale.
  - Tools Needed: Install react-hook-form, zod, uuid, zustand for full implementation.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize dashboard and migration in next sprint; conduct code review for partial form.

## 3. Quality Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Test Coverage |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Data Migration Failure (v1 single → v2 array) | High | High | Implement safe, opt-in migration with backup prompt; test with 100% v1 datasets. | Regression suite: 10 TC for migration paths (success/fail/partial data). |
| Performance Degradation (>20 schedules) | Medium | High | Virtualization (react-window) for list; benchmark <1s load. | Load tests: Simulate 50-200 schedules; monitor LCP/FID. |
| UX Inconsistencies (Empty State/Mobile) | Medium | Medium | A/B usability tests; responsive audits with Chrome DevTools. | E2E: 5 TC for mobile flows; Lighthouse >90 Accessibility/Performance. |
| Search/Filter Bugs (Debounce/Case-Insensitivity) | Low | Medium | Unit tests for utils; manual exploratory testing. | Unit: 80% coverage for search logic; Integration: Filter persistence. |
| localStorage Quota Exceed | Low | Low | Auto-export prompt at 80% quota; compress JSON. | Edge: TC for quota scenarios (export fallback). |

- **Non-Functional Risks**: Accessibility (WCAG AA for cards/dropdowns); Security (sanitize inputs to prevent XSS in titles).
- **Overall Risk Level**: Medium - Mitigable with early testing; monitor integration with housekeeping epic (HK-001 US-001 reuse).

## 4. Testing Recommendations
### 4.1 Test Strategy
- **Levels**:
  - **Unit**: Test dashboard hooks (useScheduleStore), utils (search debounce, filter logic). Target 80% coverage with Vitest.
  - **Integration**: CRUD flows (create → list → edit → delete); migration with Zustand store.
  - **E2E**: Full user journeys (Playwright/Cypress): Empty → Create → Search/Filter → Paginate → Mobile view.
  - **Performance**: Lighthouse audits; load tests for 50 schedules (use Artillery or custom scripts).
  - **Usability**: 5-user sessions focusing on admin persona; SUS score >80.
  - **Compatibility**: v1 backward (no regressions); browsers (Chrome/FF/Safari/Edge); devices (mobile/desktop).
- **Test Cases Overview** (High-Level; Full Plan in docs/US-001-test-plan.md):
  - TC-001-010: Dashboard rendering (empty/full/paginated).
  - TC-011-020: Search/Filter (exact/partial/no results).
  - TC-021-030: CRUD actions (create/edit/delete/undo).
  - TC-031-040: Migration (v1 data import, edge cases like empty/invalid).
  - TC-041-050: Performance/Accessibility (load times, ARIA, keyboard nav).
- **Automation Priority**: 70% automated (unit/integration/E2E); manual for exploratory/usability.
- **Defect Prediction**: Focus on race conditions in auto-save; invalid states post-migration.

### 4.2 Quality Gates
- **Alpha**: 100% AC pass; no P0/P1 bugs; unit tests green.
- **Beta**: Usability sign-off; performance benchmarks met; integration with US-002.
- **Release**: Full regression; zero migration data loss; deploy to staging for stakeholder review.
- **Metrics**: Bug escape rate <5%; test coverage >85%; MTTR <1 day.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Complete dynamic form and dashboard (2-3 days).
  2. Implement migration with tests (1 day).
  3. Install dependencies and add Zod validation.
- **Quality Enhancements**:
  - Add error boundaries for dashboard loads.
  - Instrument analytics for usage (e.g., schedule creation events).
  - Conduct peer review for partial code.
- **Long-Term**: Extend to cloud sync (post-v2); A/B test dashboard layouts.
- **Dependencies**: Coordinate with Dev for implementation; QA for test plan creation.
